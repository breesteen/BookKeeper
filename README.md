Built with Java(IntelliJ), HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, SQL, Spring.

## Project Status
In Progress

#### Stage

This project is currently in development.

#### Purpose

This is a side project I am building during my third module at Tech Elevator. Project goals - using technologies and concepts learned up until this point.


REST
MVC
DAO
PostgreSQL
SQL
Springboot

I started by designing the app's database schema. Currently working on hooking up  server-side Book Service to GoogleBooks API so users can search
for books they want to keep track of in their library.

Concerned with authroization. Need to do research on OAuth and two-factor authentication.
